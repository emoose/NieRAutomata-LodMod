# NieRAutomata-LodMod

An XInput/DInput/DXGI wrapper DLL that hooks into NieR Automata (PC ver.) and disables object LODs, improves shadow quality/distances, and much more!

### Thanks
Many thanks to Raincode for their https://github.com/Raincode/DeskCalc project, the parser code of which is used in LodMod for parsing math expressions. (is quite performant, and also has nice features like temporary variables)
