; whether to write LodMod startup info to LodMod.log
; (will be written out to same folder as the LodMod.ini that was read in)
; useful if you need to check if LodMod is actually loading in/reading your settings properly
; this'll also warn you if a setting wasn't actually applied by the game for some reason
DebugLog = false

; allows increasing LOD distances or disabling them entirely
; can help with AO-bleed without the full perf hit of LODs being disabled
; you can disable LODs by setting this to 0, or set to 1 to leave LODs vanilla
; for getting rid of AO bleed, a value of 10 or above is recommended (or 0)
; (minimum: 0 (LODs disabled), maximum: ???, game default: 1)
LODMultiplier = 0

; how many high-quality map slots/cells are around the player
; increasing this can increase the distance that the HQ version of maps is visible for
; not all HQ map-sections are affected by this though, some seem to use manually set distances for switching between HQ/LQ, I guess to squeeze out even more performance...
; speaking of performance, this will likely have a performance hit!
; (minimum: 7, maximum: 15, game default: 7)
HQMapSlots = 7

; AO resolution in vanilla game is set to half your screen res
; changing the multiplier below lets you increase the resolution, note that this can be quite heavy though
; eg with multiplier 2 this can have ~10FPS difference in worst case...
; (minimum: 0.1, maximum: 2, game default: 1, 1.5 might be a good value for some people)
AOMultiplier = 1

; sharpness of shadows is determined by both resolution & distance
; the larger the distance, the more of the map has to be fit into the given resolution, decreasing the quality of shadows
; defaults of 8192 resolution/70 distance should match vanilla's quality, while increasing the distance greatly
; if you'd like shadow quality increased just decrease the distance, or increase the resolution
; resolution must be power of 2: 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768(?)
; (minimum: 2048, maximum: GPU-dependant, game default: 2048)

ShadowDistanceMaximum = 0 ; only worth setting if default game distances give you perf issues

; allows multiplying the per-scene shadow distance, disable Minimum/Maximum above for this to work properly
; (alternatively you can use Minimum/Maximum above to restrict what this multiplier sets it to)
; (game default: 1)
ShadowDistanceMultiplier = 1 

; experimental: disables manual-culling triggers, helping to prevent models from disappearing
; seems these triggers were mostly placed to cull off-screen objects, I guess to help with performance
; many times the objects being culled aren't actually off-screen though, resulting in things randomly disappearing/reappearing depending on camera position...
; unfortunately there's also some ugly LOD models that rely on these triggers for the LOD to be removed & replaced with the HQ version
; I've added a filter which should hopefully catch most LOD models and let them get culled, but there's always a chance one could slip by
; if you notice any LODs remaining loaded in when close-up with this, please let me know about it!
DisableManualCulling = true

; experimental: allows you to adjust the strength of the filter applied to shadows, filter seems to just blur it to reduce aliasing
; adjusting this could help increase sharpness of shadows without needing to reduce distance/increase resolution too much
; or help soften up shadows if you feel you've made them too sharp
; different game areas seem to use different filter strengths, eg. forest uses a high value which makes shadows softer
; there's two options for adjusting this: either set ShadowFilterStrengthMinimum/Maximum to force the whole game to certain strengths
; or you can use ShadowFilterBias instead which can adjust the strength in a certain direction when an area is loaded instead
; (alternatively you can combine Bias with Minimum/Maximum to restrict the values Bias sets it to)
; (game default is usually 4, but can change per-scene)
ShadowFilterStrengthBias = 0 ; set to 0 to disable, -1 might be a good value

ShadowFilterStrengthMinimum = 0 ; set to 0 to disable
ShadowFilterStrengthMaximum = 0 ; set to 0 to disable

; experimental: lets you tweak the resolution of the communication screens projected from your pod
; (the 3d-renders that appear when receiving comms from another character)
; game seems to render at this resolution and then do a simple rescale
; there isn't really much visual difference from changing this, but it's here if you want 
; resolution must be power of 2: 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768(?)
