[LodMod]
; whether to write LodMod startup info to LodMod.log
; (will be written out to same folder as the LodMod.ini that was read in)
; useful if you need to check if LodMod is actually loading in/reading your settings properly
; this'll also warn you if a setting wasn't actually applied by the game for some reason
DebugLog = false

; allows increasing LOD distances or disabling them entirely
; can help with AO-bleed without the full perf hit of LODs being disabled
; or you can disable LODs by setting this to 0
; set to 1 to leave LODs vanilla
; for getting rid of AO bleed, a value of 10 or above is recommended (or 0)
; (minimum: 0 (LODs disabled), maximum: ???, game default: 1)
LODMultiplier = 0

; AO resolution in vanilla game is set to half your screen res
; changing the multiplier below lets you increase the resolution, note that this can be quite heavy though
; eg with multiplier 2 this can have ~10FPS difference in worst case...
; (minimum: 0.1, maximum: 2, game default: 1, 1.5 might be a good value for some people)
AOMultiplier = 1

; sharpness of shadows is determined by both resolution & distance
; the larger the distance, the more of the map has to be fit into the given resolution, decreasing the quality of shadows
; defaults of 8192 resolution/70 distance should match vanilla's quality, while increasing the distance greatly
; if you'd like shadow quality increased just decrease the distance, or increase the resolution
; resolution must be power of 2: 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768(?)
; (minimum: 2048, maximum: GPU-dependant, game default: 2048)
ShadowResolution = 8192

ShadowMinimumDistance = 70 ; set to 0 to disable
ShadowMaximumDistance = 0 ; only worth setting if default game distances give you perf issues

; experimental: lets you tweak the resolution of the communication screens projected from your pod
; (the 3d-renders that appear when receiving comms from another character)
; game seems to render at this resolution and then do a simple rescale
; there isn't really much visual difference from this, but it's here if you want 
; resolution must be power of 2: 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768(?)
; (minimum: 1, maximum: GPU-dependant, game default: 256)
